- Formatting references and citations

## Key Deadlines

| Milestone | Date |

## Formatting Requirements

### Page Limits

## Anonymization Checklist

Before submission, verify:
- [ ] No author names in paper

## Review Process

IJCAI uses two-phase reviewing:
1. **Phase 1**: Every paper receives 2 reviews
2. **Phase 2**: Papers advancing receive additional reviews + author response opportunity

## Generative AI Policy

> "Generative AI models do not satisfy the criteria for authorship"

If using LLMs (like Claude):
- Authors assume **full responsibility** for all content
- Must check for plagiarism
- Must verify correctness of entire submission
- Recommended: Include brief disclosure in methodology or appendix

### Sample Disclosure Statement
```latex
\paragraph{Use of AI Assistants.}
This work used Claude Code for code refactoring, documentation generation,
and literature search assistance. All generated content was reviewed,
verified, and edited by the authors who take full responsibility for
the final submission.
```

## Resubmission Policy

If paper was rejected from another venue in the last 12 months:
- Must declare the previous submission
- Upload anonymized rejected version with reviewer comments
- Cover letter responding to reviews is optional but recommended

## Submission Limits

- Each author: Maximum **8 submissions** to IJCAI-ECAI 2026

## BibTeX Best Practices for CS

When using the DBLP MCP server:
```
Use mcp__dblp__search to find papers
Use mcp__dblp__bibtex to get accurate BibTeX entries
```

DBLP entries are authoritative - they won't be hallucinated.
